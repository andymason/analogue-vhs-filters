Analogue VHS Filters
====================

Create glitched and distorted images by manipulating canvas data array.
Uses native JavaScript without WebGL so is CPU intensive and slow.


TO DO
-----
* Scale effects relative to canvas size, not pixel width
* Render large image to data uri crashes browser
* Add more example configs
* Image layer with composite effects
* Save filter setting locally
* Web cam import
* Tilt shift blur
* Normalise variable names
* Import image from URL (needs base64 image proxy. Use GAE?)
* Full credits


Done list
---------
* Progress bar. Needed for large renders (1920x1080)
* Fix bend doing RGB shifts
* Clean-up export/import code
* Proper export settings
* Update ghosting effect to be more realistic
* Import settings
* Effect callbacks
* JPEG corruption (Thanks to snorpey)
* Render 100% CPU (drawImage)
* RGB LED image overlays, tile x/y (MAME has RGB images)
* Upload to 3rd party host (imgur?)
* Import image from local FS
* Export large image (specify dimensions)
* Click & touch drag to generate distortion (per filter?)


Not going to do
---------------
* Mobile version
* WebGl optimised
